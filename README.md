## Goal

You are a React front-end developer, and we provided you a JSON file containing a transactions list.
Each transaction has a label.
Your goal is to provide an SPA (Single Page Application) using React to facilitate searching for a specific transaction using the label.

The app should contain:
- A search input where the user can type to search for a transaction with a specific label.
- A list of transactions that should be filtered when the user type.
- A beautiful UI using the library of your choice (Chakra UI, Tailwind css...).

## Specificities

- The search logic should filter based on the label and shouldn't be case-sensitive.
- The UI should be meticulously implemented and designed.
- Use as much good practices as possible.
- You are free to use any libraries you want, except for the search logic.

## Delivering the test

- If you can, deliver it to vercel or netlify so we can test it easily.
